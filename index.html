        <h1>A Little Tour of Dubai</h1>
        <p class="lead">Embrace its beaches, luxury and technology</p>
        <p>According to Wikipedia: "Aspects of Dubai's old culture, while occasionally overshadowed by the boom in
          economic development, can be found by visiting places around the creek, which splits Dubai into two halves,
          Bur
          Dubai and Deira. The buildings lining the Bur Dubai side of the Creek provide the main flavor of the old city.
          Heritage Village is one of the few remaining parts of historical Dubai, containing preserved buildings. The
          adjoining Diving Village offers exhibits on pearl diving and fishing. The Diving Village forms part of an
          ambitious plan to turn the entire "Shindagha" area into a cultural city, recreating life in Dubai as it was in
          days gone by.
        </p>

        <p> Other attractions include the Sheikh Saeed Al Maktoum House; the Dubai Museum in the restored Al Fahidi
          Fort,
          which was erected around 1799; and the Heritage Village of Hatta, situated 115 kilometers southeast of Dubai
          City in the heart of the rocky Hatta Mountains. The history of the village can be traced back 2000 â€“ 3000
          years.
          It consists of 30 buildings, each differing in size, interior layout and building materials used. Great care
          was
          taken to use the same materials as those used when originally built during the renovation such as mud, hay,
          sandalwood and palm fronds. The Sharia Mosque is an old mosque built in the early 19th century using the same
          building materials and consists of a large prayer hall, a court and courtyard, minaret and other utility
          rooms. Other museums include the Al Ahmadiya School."

        <p>"On 2 November 2011, four cities had their bids for Expo 2020 already lodged, with Dubai making a last-minute
          entry. The delegation from the Bureau International des Expositions, which visited Dubai in February 2013 to
          examine the Emirate's readiness for the largest exposition, was impressed by the infrastructure and the level
          of national support. In May 2013, Dubai Expo 2020 Master Plan was revealed. Dubai then won the right to
          host Expo 2020 on 27 November 2013. The event will bring huge economic benefits by generating activities
          worth billions of dirhams and may create over 270,000 jobs.

          The main site of Dubai Expo 2020 will be a 438-hectare area (1,083 acres), part of the new Dubai Trade Centre
          Jebel Ali urban development, located midway between Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Moreover, the Expo 2020 also
          created various social enlistment projects and monetary boons to the city targeting the year 2020, such as
          initiating the world's largest solar power project.

          The Dubai Expo 2020 is to take place from 20 October 2020 till 10 April 2021 for 173 days where there are to
          be 192 country pavilions featuring narratives from every part of the globe, have different thematic districts
          that would promote learning the wildlife in the forest exhibit to many other experiences.

          Due to the impact of COVID-19 the organisers of EXPO are seeking to postpone the EXPO by one year to begin in
          2021.

          Dubai is trying to build an inclusive, barrier-free and a disabled-friendly city by the time it hosts Expo
          2020. The city has already brought in changes by introducing wheelchair friendly taxis, pavements with slopes
          and tactile indicators on floor for the visually-impaired at all the metro stations."</p>
